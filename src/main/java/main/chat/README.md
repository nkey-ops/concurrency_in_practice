### Project Requirements: **Command-Line Chat Application with Socket Communication**

#### Overview:
The project will involve creating a **command-line chat application** where multiple users can communicate with each other over a network using **socket programming**. The system should be able to handle **multiple concurrent connections** (clients) and allow them to send and receive messages in real-time.

The chat application will be designed to run in a **client-server model**:
- The **server** will listen for incoming connections from clients, manage these connections, and relay messages between clients.
- The **clients** will allow users to send and receive messages, view the list of connected users, and disconnect from the chat.

### Requirements:

#### 1. **Functional Requirements:**

1. **Client-Server Model:**
   - **Server**:
     - Listens on a specific port for incoming client connections.
     - Manages multiple client connections concurrently using sockets.
     - Relays messages from one client to other connected clients in real-time.
     - Handles user login, message broadcasting, and client disconnection.
   - **Client**:
     - Connects to the server via a specified IP address and port.
     - Sends text messages to the server to be broadcasted to all connected clients.
     - Receives messages from the server.
     - Allows users to send commands like `/list` to view connected users, and `/exit` to disconnect.

2. **Multiple Client Support:**
   - The server should be capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously. Each client will operate in a separate thread to ensure non-blocking message sending/receiving.
   - Each client should be able to send and receive messages concurrently, while maintaining the order of communication.

3. **Real-Time Communication:**
   - Messages should be relayed immediately to all clients.
   - When one client sends a message, it should appear on all connected clients almost instantly.

4. **User Authentication (Optional)**:
   - Clients can authenticate with a username when connecting to the server.
   - The server should store each clientâ€™s username and associate it with their connection.
   - Each message should be prefixed with the username of the sender.

5. **Message History (Optional)**:
   - The server should store recent messages (last N messages, or for the current session) and display them to new users when they connect.

6. **Commands:**
   - `/list`: Lists all currently connected users.
   - `/exit`: Disconnects the client from the server and terminates the chat session.
   - `/help`: Displays available commands and usage instructions.

7. **Disconnect Handling:**
   - When a client disconnects, the server should remove the client from the active users list and broadcast a message to all remaining users, notifying them of the disconnection.

8. **Graceful Shutdown:**
   - The server should be able to shutdown gracefully, ensuring all client connections are terminated properly.
   - Clients should also handle server shutdown gracefully, reconnecting or displaying appropriate messages.

#### 2. **Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Concurrency:**
   - The system should support **multiple clients** connecting to the server at the same time, with each client having its own thread or using a thread pool to handle communication.
   - Communication between the client and server should be non-blocking and asynchronous for responsiveness.

2. **Performance:**
   - The server should efficiently handle multiple clients, broadcasting messages quickly to all connected clients.
   - The system should scale well, supporting dozens or hundreds of connected clients, depending on the system's resource limits.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The system should handle errors, such as invalid input, server unavailability, and network issues, gracefully.
   - If a client sends a malformed message, the server should respond with an error message.
   - If a client disconnects unexpectedly, the server should handle the exception and clean up resources.

4. **Security (Optional):**
   - For better security, encrypted communication (e.g., SSL/TLS) could be added, though this is optional for an initial implementation.
   - Usernames should be unique, and duplicate usernames should not be allowed.

5. **Extensibility:**
   - The system should be modular and extensible, allowing easy addition of new features such as private messaging, file sharing, or enhanced security.

6. **Cross-Platform:**
   - The chat application should run on any operating system that supports Java, allowing users to run the chat client and server on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

#### 3. **System Design:**

1. **Components:**
   - **Server**:
     - **ServerSocket**: Used to listen for incoming client connections.
     - **Thread Pool/Executor Service**: Used to manage client handler threads.
     - **ClientHandler**: A dedicated thread for each connected client that handles communication.
     - **Message Broadcasting**: Logic for broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
     - **User Management**: Stores information about connected users (e.g., username).
   - **Client**:
     - **Socket**: Used to connect to the server and send/receive messages.
     - **Input/Output Streams**: For reading user input and writing messages to the server.
     - **Console UI**: Display messages and prompt for user input in the command-line interface.
     - **Command Parsing**: Handles commands such as `/exit`, `/list`, and `/help`.

2. **Communication Protocol**:
   - Use **text-based messages** for communication (e.g., simple strings or JSON-formatted data).
   - The client sends a message, and the server relays it to all other clients.
   - Commands like `/exit` or `/list` are processed by the server and return appropriate responses.

3. **Threading Model:**
   - The **server** uses **multi-threading** to handle each client in a separate thread, allowing simultaneous communication with multiple clients.
   - The **client** handles both sending and receiving messages concurrently using multi-threading or asynchronous I/O.

4. **Error and Exception Handling**:
   - Use appropriate error handling in both client and server to ensure smooth operation and graceful shutdown in case of network failures or disconnections.

#### 4. **Technologies:**

1. **Java** 8+:
   - **Socket Programming**: Using `ServerSocket` and `Socket` for communication.
   - **Multi-threading**: Using `Thread` or `ExecutorService` to manage concurrent client connections.
   - **Input/Output Streams**: `BufferedReader` for reading input and `PrintWriter` for sending output.
   - **Data Serialization (Optional)**: JSON or XML can be used for sending structured data, but simple text-based messages can also be used.

2. **Networking**:
   - **TCP Protocol**: Use **TCP sockets** to ensure reliable communication between the client and server.

3. **Optional**:
   - **SSL/TLS Encryption**: For secure communication between clients and the server.
   - **Database (Optional)**: If you want to store user information or chat logs.

#### 5. **Performance Considerations:**

1. **Concurrency Control**:
   - The server should handle each client in its own thread, using a thread pool or executor service for scalability and efficient thread management.
   - Clients should handle sending and receiving messages concurrently to avoid blocking.

2. **Scalability**:
   - The server should be capable of handling multiple simultaneous client connections, ensuring messages are broadcast efficiently to all connected clients.
   - Proper management of resources (e.g., using `ExecutorService` and thread pooling) will ensure scalability.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The system should gracefully handle disconnected clients, network failures, and invalid input.

#### 6. **Example Interaction (Console Output)**:

**Server Logs**:
```
Server started, waiting for clients...
Client 1 connected: user1
Client 2 connected: user2
User1: Hello, anyone there?
User2: Hi, user1! How are you?
User3: /list
Current users:
1. user1
2. user2
3. user3
User1 has disconnected.
```

**Client Logs**:
```
Connected to the chat server.
Enter your username: user1
Type '/help' for a list of commands.
> Hello, anyone there?
> /list
Currently connected users:
1. user1
2. user2
3. user3
> /exit
You have disconnected from the server.
```
